# AirgeadBanking
A simple console program to calculate compound interest over a given amount of years. This was a school project for my Computer Science degree in CS-210!

*You are asked to collaborate with Airgead Banking, one of Chada Techâ€™s clients. Airgead Banking is well known in the community. 
They often sponsor schools and have recently decided to partner with the local high school to develop a program that will teach students the concepts of 
fiscal responsibility (such as living within their means and spending less than they make) via an interactive system. The initial focus for this project 
will be on investing and the power of compound interest. You will develop an application that allows users to see how their investments will grow over time. 
Airgead Banking has provided you with a list of functional requirements that describe what they need their application to do.*

## Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
  The main problem was that the banking company Airgead was joining with a high school to teach students about responsible spending and they needed an interactive program to show investments and compound interest.
  
## What did you do particularly well?
  I think the part I did particularly well on was the UserData class. My implementation of this class was in my own opinion, the best one i've done in the C++ language. The CS-210 class really helped me grasp the concepts 
  of classes and how to use them much better than my knowledge before taking the course. I believe I created this class in a very readable and simplistic manner, allowing for easily usability within the code.
  
## Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
  I could definitely enhance my input validation. This would make my code much more efficient. I could add conditions for cin.fail() and/or improper number input for the investments and so on. 
  
## Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this?
  I think the most challenging part was accurately calculating the compound interest with monthly deposits. I went through multple different ways of calculating this but somehow was still off by a few decimals. I decided to write everything out on paper and do the math mentally, this helped me see what I was doing wrong and what needed to change in my code!
  
## What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
  I confidently can say that just about everything I did with this project will help me further my other projects and future schoolwork. This project specifically made me very comfortable with using multiple header and .cpp files, it also allowed me to get more hands on experience working with c++. Getting to implement these classes and files will help me improve all of my work in the future! 
  
## How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
  I made this project maintainable by using classes and functions. This allows me to update parts of code in a much easier manner then having to change multiple sections of code. This also allowed for a readable main(), as 
  by using functions it allows for less cluttering of the main files!
